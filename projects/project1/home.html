        <h1 class="slide-left show-on-scroll">A Little Bit about Me</h1>
        <p class="slide-up-slower show-on-scroll">Hello again! This is my new personal website for DART 449. If you want to check out the similarities or differences between then and now, check out my old <a href="">homepage</a> (yet to appear)!</p>
        <p class="slide-right-slower show-on-scroll">My name is <strong>Lam Ky Anh Do</strong>, but I go by <strong><em>Falé</em></strong>. It's easier to remember, and I am currently a third-year Design student at Concordia University!</p>
        <p class="slide-right-slowest show-on-scroll">Born and raised in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, I moved to Montreal at the age of 8 for a new adventure with my family, who you can discover more in the previous version of this website. From a very
          young
          age, my education was highly academic,
          meaning I didn't have the chance to explore the wolrd of art.</p>
        <p class="slide-up-slowest show-on-scroll">Nonetheless, I was able to experience it through movies, music and manga! Thus, I wanted to learn more about this wonderful world called Art, and so after graduating from my academic international
          high school, I took the first step and
          enrolled into Dawson College's Visual Arts program, where I was able to learn and grasp a better understanding of the art world.</p>
        <p class="slide-left-slowest show-on-scroll">Drawing, photography and sculpture, especially painting and printing were enlightening, interesting and fun! However, I felt that there was something missing, as in it was not what I wanted to do
          career-wise. After a long reflection, I
          came to realize that I wanted to not only create for the sake of creating and of selling my artworks. Instead, I wanted my creations to have a purpose that can problem-solve issues, contribute to society and spread joy. Thus, Design was
          what I was looking for and I enrolled into Concordia University's Design and Computation Art program.</p>
        <p class="slide-left-slowmo show-on-scroll">So far, I enjoy what I learn as I continuously discover new things everyday and learn about so many design facets. I learned about the history of design that is constantly growing as time flies by,
          graphic design, industrial design, book
          design, web design, computation art and so much more. That said, I am leaning more towards graphic design as it is what piqued my interest in studying Design.</p>
        <p class="slide-up-slowmo show-on-scroll">Yet, I would still wish to have a multidisplinary background as a graphic
          designer. Book design and web design are disciplines I would like to learn more about too but I still need to improve my skills by studying more about them in order to claim the right to call myself a book and web designer. Though I am
          still exploring, I usually work with <strong>Functionality, Aesthetic and Playfulness</strong> to design and I look for <strong>Joy, Efficiency and Simplicity</strong> in my designs. In essence, I aspire to become a designer
          who spreads positivity and happiness. </p>
