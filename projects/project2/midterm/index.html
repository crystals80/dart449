        <h1 class="slide-left show-on-scroll" style="padding-bottom: 1.5rem">Proposal Essay on an Informative Narrative about Endangered Sea Turtles</h1>
        <p class="slide-up show-on-scroll">Dating from the Middle Jurassic Epoch¹, turtles are among the oldest living reptiles on earth and there are approximately 356 species of turtles living on both fresh and salt waters, and on land in all
          continents except Antarctica. That said, of the seven sea turtle species worldwide, six of them are classified as threatened or endangered due to human activities, including their lifestyles. This means due our actions and decisions, we
          have polluted the air we breathe, the land we live on and the sea of water filled with wonders. Accordingly, I would like to make a stand for these innocent creatures because they have suffered due to our doings when they have done nothing
          wrong to deserve this kind of torture, where they get trapped in shrimp trawl nets, on longline hooks, in fishing gillnets and in six-pack rings, get hunted down for their eggs, meat, skin, and shells, sea turtles suffer from poaching and
          over-exploitation, and get their home stripped off due to global warming triggering a progressive rise in temperature and due to our interest in extracting fossil fuels by mining and drilling the soil that has welcomed us as living beings
          on planet Earth. With that said, I would like to make a website about endangered sea turtles in order to spread awareness about our wrongdoings to these wonderful marine beings in hope that people will come to realize that it is now that we
          have to take action to save not only our planet but also save our numerous friendly neighbours, as we all share a place we can call home.</p>
        <p class="slide-up-slower show-on-scroll">Concerning the issue with sea turtles being endangered by human activities, especially affected by global warming and water pollution, I chose to talk about these marine reptiles because they are one
          of the mascots representing marine life and I find that there is a need to make people, who lives on land, understand better marine life, in which is not an area where people can live in as they cannot breathe underwater. That said, I would
          like to enlighten society about these creatures that can live on both land and water in hope that we can learn more about the struggle these sea turtles are being put through and that we can take something out of this learning matter and
          co-exist with our biodiversity, rather than destroying it. It would be a tragic marking event to have another species turning into fossils and we would not want to see that happening, especially in the 21st century.</p>
        <p class="slide-up-slowest show-on-scroll">“Over the last 200 years, human activities have tipped the scales against the survival of these ancient mariners. Slaughtered for their eggs, meat, skin, and shells, sea turtles suffer from poaching
          and over-exploitation. They also face habitat destruction and accidental capture—known as bycatch—in fishing gear. Climate change has an impact on turtle nesting sites; it alters sand temperatures, which then affects the sex of hatchlings.
          Nearly all species of sea turtle are now classified as endangered, with three of the seven existing species being critically endangered.²” Hence, I find that we are crucial times where one cannot control the temperature of the oceans and
          certainly not the natural disasters being done by and to the oceans. So I believe that it is essential to spread awareness about endangered sea turtles in order to prevent more catastrophies happening to marine life and to initiate the
          first step help saving our biodiversity—if we can save one sea turtle species, then we can save a whole species of reptiles.</p>
        <p class="slide-up-slowmo show-on-scroll">Without further ado, I plan to elaborate more on the following endangered sea turtles species: green sea turtles, hawksbill sea turtles, loggerhead sea turtles, leatherback sea turtles and olive
          ridley sea turtle. Following up on what I have just proposed, I will build an informative website that narrates the life of each of these sea turtles. In other words, I will introduce the species by elaborating on their origins, where they
          live, what makes them special—their particular features, why they are endangered and how we, as a society, can prevent them from going extinct. I plan to make the website friendly in all aspects, which includes a friendly atmosphere, a
          user-friendly website with a simple and friendly aesthetics. One thing I hope to achieve is to create various scrolling examples that includes long and parallax scrollings to give the audience a sense of playfulness with orientation. What I
          mean by this is to provide a somewhat immersive experience as if they were swimming with these turtles as they scroll through the page. I plan to use a set of friendly sans-serif typefaces, namely Calistoga for headers and Comfortaa for
          the
          body text. I might consider adding the typeface Coiny but that is to be considered after I laid down all my information on the website and depending on the changes made to the website is presented. As for the colour palette, I plan to use
          colours that revolves around turquoise, teal and sea blue colours—indicating marine life—and for accent colours, I will use earthtones colours, such as brown and cream colours—denoting the sea turtles. All things considered, I would like to
          keep the website as straightforward and simple as possible while making it responsive and fun for the user.</p>
